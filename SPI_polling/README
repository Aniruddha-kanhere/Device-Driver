This section of the repository has the polling version of SPI data transfer from the MCSPI0 module of the beaglebone black. The user can (currently) configure the module by directly modifying the (struct MCSPI) mcspi present in the MCSPI_mod.c file. For available configuration options one can look into the MCSPI_reg.h file which has definitions of the registers and the values it can possibly take.
 
In (near) future I will try to update this by making the 'ioctl' functionality available such that user can just access the /dev/SPI file and configure the functionality of the MCSPI module.

Also (in near) future, I will be uploading the Interrupt driven versions of the SPI device driver (in another directory within the same repo).

If you just want to transmit some message with the given (default) configuration, just type "make" after traversing to the directory of this project. If all goes well, you'll have an executable file called testSPI (Huzzah!!). Just execute it using "./testSPI" and follow the commands.
